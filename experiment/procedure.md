### Materials Required:
 

1. Monoclonal Antibodies ( Anti-A, B and D)
2. Blood Lancet
3. Alcohol swabs
4. Tooth picks
5. Sterile cotton balls
6. Clean glass slide
7. Ice tray
8. Biohazard disposal container
 

### Procedure:
 

1. Set the table with all the materials required. Remember to place the Monoclonal Antibody (Mab) kit in an Ice tray.
2. Open an Alcohol swab, and rub it at the area from where the blood will be sampled (finger tip). (Discard the swab)
3. Open the Lancet cover, put pressure at the tip of the finger from where blood will be sampled (maintain it). Prick the finger tip with the opened Lancet.(Discard the Lancet)
4. As blood starts oozing out, make 1 drop fall on the three depressions of the glass slide. (in clinical setup, there will be a fourth well used as a control).
5. Place a cotton ball at the site where it was pricked. Using the thumb, put pressure on the area to stop blood flow.
6. Take the Anti-A (blue) bottle, resuspend the content and use the dropper to place a drop of the Mab in the 1st spot. Place the bottle back in ice.
7. Take the Anti-B (yellow) bottle, resuspend the content and use the dropper to place a drop of the Mab in the 2nd spot. Place the bottle back in ice.
8. Take the Anti-D (colorless) bottle, resuspend the content and use the dropper to place a drop of the Mab in the 3rd spot. Place the bottle back in ice.
9. Take a tooth pick and mix the content in each well. Discard the tooth pick after using in one well (take a new one for the next well).
10. After mixing, wait for a while to observe the result.
